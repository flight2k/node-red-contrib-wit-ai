You will need the `Server Access Token` that can be found in the Settings menu of your Wit.ai app.\r\n\r\nWit.ai API conformance\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n20160330\r\n\r\nhttps://wit.ai/docs/http/20160330\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nProvides these nodes:\r\n\r\nNote: One each of __Merge__, __Say__ and __Error__ are required to be in the flow. Also, one __Action__ node for each defined action is required.\r\n\r\n### Wit Message\r\n\r\nTakes a sentence and returns the meaning.\r\n\r\nExpects the `payload` to be a `String`.\r\n\r\nUses wit.ai's `/message` endpoint.\r\n\r\nDoes not yet support the `context`, `msg_id`, `thread_id`, and `n` parameters.\r\n\r\n### Wit Converse\r\n\r\nThis is the node where you send a question or statement to your Wit.ai bot. Typically you would hook this up to a messaging app like Slack or Facebook Messanger.\r\n\r\nYou can provide a `sessionId` and a `context` along with the `payload`. If not, they will be created for you.\r\n\r\nAfter the __Converse__ node has been given a message, the __Merge__, __Action__ and __Say__ nodes will trigger.\r\n\r\n### Wit Merge\r\n\r\nFor each configured Wit.ai bot you must provide one single __Merge__ node. After a message has been sent to the bots __Converse__ node, the __Merge__ node will trigger and send a message with a `context` and `entities`.\r\n\r\nAttach a __Function__ node to the merge node and modify the provided `context` depending on the recieved `entities`.\r\n\r\nThe __Function__ node must then send the message along to a __Response__ node configured for the same Wit.ai bot as the __Merge__ node where the message originated.\r\n\r\nIts best if you keep the same `msg` object through your flow, so to not loose any meta information stored by the Wit.ai bot.\r\n\r\n### Wit Action\r\n\r\nIf you have configured an action in any of your Wit.ai stories, you need to create an __Action__ node in your flow with the same action name.\r\n\r\nThis node will be triggered if the conversation identifies this action.\r\n\r\nLike the __Merge__ node, you should let the message from an __Action__ node continue to a __Response__ node. Modify the `msg` object, but don't replace it.\r\n\r\nYou can only have one __Action__ node for each action on a bot.\r\n\r\n### Wit Response\r\n\r\nA __Response__ node takes the message from a __Merge__ or __Action__ node and makes sure the conversation continues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Wit Say\r\n\r\nThe __Say__ node is triggered when the bot has something to say. Typically you would forward the `payload` to a messaging system like Slack or Facebook Messanger.\r\n\r\n### Wit Error\r\n\r\nThe __Error__ node outputs any errors that was enconuntered during the conversation. This could be forwarded to a messaging system.\r\n\r\n### Sample Flow\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n",
